#Advertiser With and Without Timeslot API

This project is an example of using timeslot API to built an scannable and connectable advertiser . The advertiser can run with two modes : with and without timeslot API but it is not selectable in the run time .
The mode in which one would wish to run this advertiser should be set before compilation by using preprocessor directive at the start of the main.c file , ts_controller.c file and nrf_advertiser.c file of the advertiser project .
